Congratulations! You have completed the introductory course on machine learning. 

You have learned:

To tell classification from regression; a model from a learning algorithm
To train a model and measure its quality using the sklearn library
To evaluate and test models
The next course will be also dedicated to supervised learning. You will learn new evaluation metrics and explore new ways to make models even better.
