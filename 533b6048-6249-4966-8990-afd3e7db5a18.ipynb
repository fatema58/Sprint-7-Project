    "The finding indicates that the Random Forest model, which was trained on a training set and validated on a separate validation set, achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.778 on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: Accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the test set. In this case, the Random Forest model correctly predicted the mobile plan (Smart or Ultra) for approximately 77.85% of the subscribers in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: An accuracy of 0.778 suggests that the Random Forest model performs reasonably well in predicting the appropriate mobile plan for Megaline's subscribers. However, it's slightly below the cross-validation accuracy obtained during model evaluation on the validation set, which was around 0.820. This difference in accuracy between the validation set and the test set is expected due to the variability in the data and the randomness in the test set samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Despite the slight drop in accuracy compared to the validation set, the Random Forest model still meets the threshold of 0.75 accuracy specified for this project. Therefore, it can be considered suitable for recommending mobile plans to Megaline's subscribers. However, further analysis and monitoring may be required to ensure the model's continued effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "    In conclusion, the project aimed to develop a classification model for a mobile carrier (Megaline) to recommend the appropriate plan (Smart or Ultra) to subscribers based on their behavior. The following steps were undertaken:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: The initial phase involved preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Development: Various classification algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, were trained and evaluated using cross-validation on a training set. Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using a validation set, and their performance was compared based on accuracy. The best-performing model was selected for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity Checking: A series of sanity checks were performed on the selected model to ensure its predictions aligned with expectations and common sense. These checks included examining the distribution of predicted classes, confusion matrix analysis, feature importances, and individual prediction inspections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Evaluation: The selected model was evaluated using an independent test set to obtain an unbiased estimate of its performance. The accuracy on the test set provided a final assessment of the model's quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project aimed to develop a model that could accurately recommend one of Megaline's newer plans (Smart or Ultra) based on subscribers' behavior. After preprocessing the data and training several classification models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, we achieved promising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model, with the best hyperparameters {'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 4, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'n_estimators': 200}, demonstrated a cross-validation score of approximately 0.810 and an accuracy of approximately 0.820 on the validation set. Subsequent evaluation on the test set yielded an accuracy of approximately 0.778, indicating its reliability in predicting subscribers' plan choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Gradient Boosting model, with the best hyperparameters {'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 3, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'n_estimators': 100}, exhibited competitive performance with a cross-validation score of approximately 0.807 and an accuracy of approximately 0.820 on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both models met the accuracy threshold of 0.75, the Random Forest model slightly outperformed the Gradient Boosting model on the test set. However, individual predictions revealed areas where the model could be further refined to improve accuracy and better cater to subscribers' needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the developed models provide valuable insights into subscribers' behavior and offer a reliable framework for recommending appropriate mobile plans. Further optimization and refinement could enhance the models' predictive capabilities, ultimately benefiting Megaline by maximizing subscriber satisfaction and plan adoption.\n",
